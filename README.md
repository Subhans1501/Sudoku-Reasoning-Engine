# # Sudoku Logic Engine: Automated Reasoning
### # Solving Sudoku via Propositional and First-Order Logic (FOL)

This project explores the power of formal logic in solving times combinatorial puzzles. By reducing Sudoku rules to logical entailment problems, this engine uses resolution and inference to derive consistent solutions.

# # 🚀 Key Features
* **Dual-Reasoning Paradigms**: Provides solutions using both **Propositional Logic** and **First-Order Logic (FOL)**.
* **Propositional Formulation**: Encodes cell constraints using X_{r,c,n} variables and CNF transformations.
* **First-Order Predicates**: Uses high-level predicates like Filled(r, c, n)$ to define universal and existential constraints for rows, columns, and 3 times subgrids.
* **Formal Verification**: Models the puzzle as a satisfiability problem, ensuring that every number placement follows strict logical axioms.
